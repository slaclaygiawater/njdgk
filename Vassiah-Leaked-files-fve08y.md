Like many social media personalities, Vassiah has faced her fair share of controversies and criticisms. From her explicit content to her involvement in various feuds, Vassiah's online presence has been a subject of debate and discussion. However, she has always remained unapologetic about her choices and has used these controversies as opportunities to engage with her audience and address any concerns or misconceptions. Vassiah has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
