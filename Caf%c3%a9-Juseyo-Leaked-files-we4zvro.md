Since her breakthrough exhibition, Café Juseyo has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Café Juseyo has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. In 2019, Café Juseyo ventured into creating adult content, selling webcam sessions and explicit photos. This move escalated her controversy, with critics expressing concerns over the sexualization of her young audience. She has faced bans and restrictions on various platforms due to her explicit content.
